# ðŸª™ Verse Token ($VRS)

**IntoTheVerse** platform works on a _dual token economy. While_ capitalizing on the advances in the blockchain, NFT, and DeFi ecosystems, our game, aims to operate using two tokens, covering the liquidity, play2earn rewards, platform, and governance aspects of Into The Verse.

The main token of IntoTheVerse is called the $cVRS token (abbreviated as Celo Verse), and will be a **fixed** supply token with an initial mint supply of 1,000,000,000 without any discretion to vary its supply.

$cVRS is the project token in which a public sale will be held. It is the game transaction token, which will be used to exchange for other crypto-currencies, buy NFTs for the metaverse, participate in arenas, and for staking.

In addition, frequent burns and staking mechanisms will take place to ensure an appropriate amount of inflation and liquidity. At the same time, we leave the possibility to inflate the token at 2-3% to provide sufficient liquidity and a smooth gaming experience.

Users would be able to stake UBE LP tokens to earn rewards in $cVRS tokens, in our 'Ubeswap' banks.&#x20;

$cVRS stakers will be receiving daily rewards based on in-game activity, earning $DGN, which they can sell on the market, or use for use to breed new warriors, unlock newer dungeons and purchase marketplace items.

Note: Rewards will be based on a locked time period, the higher times yielding  higher reward rates.

$cVRS staking will also empower stakes with an additional future utility, such as:

* Voting power in the DAO and newer proposals.
* Special access to staker-exclusive metaverse avenues, real-estate ownership, exclusive giveaways, dungeons, and rare-warriors.
* Ecosystem Partner drops and releases.

Besides buying $cVRS on market after the token launch in 2021, players would also be able to earn $cVRS rewards through LP token staking on Ubeswap. (wait for the official announcements in Q1 2022)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: LP staking on Ubeswap, will not be subject to a token lock-up but, on the other hand staking $cVRS will be a locked form of staking for fixed reward rates, proportional to the amount of time, the tokens would be locked for.&#x20;

The LP rewards will be split among all LPs, proportional to their share of the liquidity pool tokens deposited.
