# ðŸ“… Weekly Challenges

The **Dungeon Keeper** finds new dungeons every week and stands guard at the entrance. Ideally every warrior is given only one chance to enter the new dungeon, to prove thier might and clear the dungeon by the **Dungeon Keeper**. As he has been living in these dungeons for a while, he is corrupted by the dark forces and takes payments from the failed warriors in $DGN tokens to give them another try.

Warriors have to win the Dungeon by completing the objective without dying a painful death from the hands of monsters. They can either kill the monsters or avoide them to save their HP. Warriors can also open the hidden chests scattered across the dungeon. They gain random number of $DGN tokens on succesfully opening the hidden chests. These chests can also have goblins sneaking inside them. If the warrior unfortunatly opens a chest with goblin he looses most of the tokens earned until then. They might also loose upto 20% of the HP depending on their guild.
