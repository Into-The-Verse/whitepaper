# ðŸ¥‡ 1v1 Duel

People are not supposed to use their Warriors to fight against other people or their warriors. But the greed of some people knows no limits. **Dungeon Keeper** has amassed a huge following due to his corrupt nature. One of the follower who goes by the psuedo name **Acolyte** saw the opportunity of managing fights between the noble Warriors.

The Dungeons from the previous weeks that have been cleared of all the wealth and monsters are used by the **Acolyte** to run fight club, where Warriors can stake some of their $DGN tokens and fight against each other. **Acolyte** charges 3% of the total tokens staked in the each fight and the winner takes the rest while the loser is left sore.

> _**Acolyte** has the agreement with the users that **if their warrior dies** inside the dungeon while fighting other warriors, he **has the right to own that warrior forever.**_
>
> _**Acolyte** gives the loser to an opportunity to revive their warrior, by referring them to his master the **Dungeon Keeper.** As the Dungeon Keeper is of mystical origin, he has the power to revive the dead. In order to save warrior you have to pay him 40% of the warrior's worth in $DGN tokens. (30% for the **Dungeon Keeper**  and 10% for the **Acolyte**)_
