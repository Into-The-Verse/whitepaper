# ðŸ“Š Stats

Warriors hail from different guilds, all of them have some added advantage, unique to their guild. The capabilities of the warriors are governed by some traits, determined by their class, their guild's bonus traits, their rarity, and bonuses applied during the summoning process.

## Hit Points (HP)

Hit Points is the measure of how alive a warrior is. If they become injured during a loot/mission, they lose their HP. To revive the warrior to its max HP, players can spend some tokens to buy potions. If this goes to 0, the hero dies, the player has two choices either to revive the warrior using a special stone, or to let it perish forever.

if a warrior is not revived for a specific time period after the battle, it gets burnt forever and the player loses that particular warrior's NFT.

## Stamina (STM)

Stamina is used to perform raids. If the warrior runs of stamina, they must rest naturally on their Taverns (1 STM recovers every 40 minutes) or visit the Dungeon Keeper, to buy "DOSI", a concoction to measurably increase their stamina recovery rate.

## Fortitude (FOR)

A character's fortitude count enhances resistance to damage during a raid, and also during duels. The fortitude can be powered up using "IMMUNIS", a rare concoction for immunity, to make the warrior less prone to damage.

## Deftness (DFT)

Deftness aids during attacks, ie; the intensity of the attack will be enhanced based on a multiplier.    The DFT enhances proportionately depending upon battles won, but a warrior can also be equipped with "PERITUS", a rare steroid, for power-ups during battles.&#x20;
