# âœŒ Social Impact

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Impact Market.gif>)

We live in one of the most urgent and challenging times in history as a society, more now with the pandemic. **Poverty** is the biggest limiting factor for human potential and development. It's the number one goal of the SDGs. For decades the traditional system has tried to end it. It's time for a new approach, that is unstoppable, censorship-resistant, fully transparent, autonomous, with maximum capital efficiency, and open to anyone in the world.

**ImpactMarket** is a decentralised poverty alleviation protocol that allows the creation and distribution of **Unconditional Basic Income** between communities and their beneficiaries, according to their needs.&#x20;

Players can donate some of their earned loot to various social causes through the donation booth placed inside the garden to [ImpactMarket](https://www.impactmarket.com)&#x20;
