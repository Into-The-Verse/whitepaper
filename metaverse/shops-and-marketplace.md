This feature will be launched later, where players can equip spells, cosmetics, weapons, shields to already owned warriors before they raid the dungeons.

The Marketplace also acts as a breeding ground for warriors, where players can also buy new warriors and later upgrade them, or sell their warriors to other players.

Est. launch to be held in Q3 2022, the game's native-marketplace will rely on **$DGN(**_in-game currency_) and **$VRS**(_governance-token_) as the primary currency, and instead of the 2.5% fee going to NFT marketplaces on Celo, a 2.5% exchange fee will be partially distributed to the stakers of $VRS metaverse token, further increasing the value of holding and staking $VRS tokens.

See our [_**token-economics**_](broken-reference) for more details.
