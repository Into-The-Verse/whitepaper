# ðŸ¤© Recreation

IntoTheVerse metaverse will be having multiple different areas and dedicated buildings for recreational activities -

* **Art Gallery -** For displaying top NFT projects like CeloPunks, CeloToadz, Celostrials, etc.
* **Chat Spaces -** These will be public chat spaces spread across the metaverse. You can enter into anyone of them by placing your avatar in these chat spaces.
* **Disco -** A dedicated building where you can enter after paying the entry fee of 1 $cVRS token. It will be leased to one of the players through an auction for three months. The tenant gains 90% of the entry fee and 10% goes back to the platform.
