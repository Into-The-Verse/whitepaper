**DYOR (Do Your Own Research)** is a common thing to hear when discussing blockchain investments. Managing your risk is an important key when investing into decentralized finance. Well said by [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/do-your-own-research) -&#x20;

_"DYOR aims to reduce the number of uninformed investors in cryptocurrency. It encourages them to research and understand a cryptocurrency before investing so that they can answer precisely why they are buying that currency and supporting that project._

_The term is also often used as a disclaimer when cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts make public posts or share their market analyses on social media platforms."_

At Into The Verse we're making a unique, interesting, and compelling experience. We are in in for the long run, and aim to create a game we are proud of. We hope that this value will be reflected in our token's value. However, we cannot guarantee anything with respect to the token price, as there are many factors that we cannot control.

**Never invest more than you can lose - you alone are responsible for your investment. DeFi Kingdoms is NOT responsible for any losses or changes in token price, and NOT responsible for any lost funds due to smart contract error or exploits.**
