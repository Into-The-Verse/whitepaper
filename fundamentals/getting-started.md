# â›½ Getting Started

IntoTheVerse is a browser-based game, so all you need to set up your system is a compatible browser with the MetaMask extension installed.&#x20;

Additionally, you will need $Celo tokens for gas fees, and to convert to $DGN within the game. In general, you will need to find an exchange like Binance, Kucoin, or Ubeswap that trades Celo, and then you will need to send the Celo to your MetaMask wallet.

Once you have your browser and MetaMask set up, and you have some Celo in your wallet, you will be able to enter the game.

As you explore, you will probably have plenty of questions. The Gameplay section offers a lot of information, and you may find what you need in the FAQ section as well. Additionally, the best place for real-time discussion and support is in our Discord server. Links to this and our other social media sites can be found on our homepage.
