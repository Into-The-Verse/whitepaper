IntoTheVerse is a **browser-based game** that would be compatible with mobile and desktop alike. so all you need to set up your system is a compatible browser with the MetaMask extension installed.

Additionally, you will need $CELO tokens for gas fees. In general, you can buy $CELO on DEXs like Ubeswap, Symmetric, or transfer $CELO to your metamask wallet from a CEX that supports Celo Network.

Further details on gameplay and user onboarding would be shared in the due course of time.
