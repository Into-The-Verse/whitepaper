# ðŸ’¡ Problems & Solution

**Problem with current Crypto Games**

* Forcing the crypto aspect into the game.
* Neglected, boring, repetitive gameplay.
* Overpromising and under-delivering or having launch dates set years into the future.

As a solution to these problems, we propose the **IntoTheVerse** metaverse with a play-to-earn **Dungeon Hunt** game:

* An open city free to roam metaverse map offering DeFi, NFTs, and much more
* Crypto aspects seamlessly tied into the gameplay with an organic need for tokens/NFTs.
* Numerous different and addictive gameplay modes.
* Well-defined scope, fast launch, and reasonable buffers for development.
